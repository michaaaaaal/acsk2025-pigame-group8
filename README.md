### DAILY WORKFLOW

|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Get latest version          | `git pull origin main`               |
| Stage your changes          | `git add .`                          |
| Stage your changes to 1 file| `git add "file.name" .`              |

### Best Practices

- Always `git pull` before you start editing anything.
- Only edit one LaTeX file at a time to avoid merge conflicts.
- Use descriptive commit messages.
- Do not commit temporary files or LaTeX build files (`.aux`, `.log`, etc.).
